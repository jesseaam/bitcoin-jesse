                A raw transaction (tx) is also known as a serialized tx. These are what allow you to send bitcoin and transact on the network. Once you learn the basic components of a raw tx, you will be able to send bitcoin even without a signing device. For example, you could construct a raw tx by hand and send it in an email or telegram and anybody that eventually receives it could transmit the tx for you. Raw Txs are really cool, and that's what we are going to breakdown today.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let's take a look at a real Bitcoin tx that was included in Block 376400: <a href="https://blockstream.info/tx/c1b4e695098210a31fe02abffe9005cffc051bbe86ff33e173155bcbdc5821e3">c1b4e695098210a31fe02abffe9005cffc051bbe86ff33e173155bcbdc5821e3</a>. Expand the collapsed section below to view the python code to retrieve the tx information from an API. We display the tx in JSON format also to make viewing the individual components of the tx easier to see.

Specifically, the 2nd output (zero-based indexing). This output was sent to address <a href="https://blockstream.info/address/1CsyjZGHctdQ1fnvKMzmga7LYoHNycZXeC">1CsyjZGHctdQ1fnvKMzmga7LYoHNycZXeC</a>.

            There are many ways to convey the information in a tx. Above we show the tx in JSON format, which is fairly easy for humans to decipher. Good block explorers will make digesting the information even easier. Computers need a different form of presentation though. txs are broadcast to the Bitcoin network in a serialized format. The serialized format of the tx above is:

            Don't let this long string of characters scare youâ€”it's literally a string guys. No teeth. Remember that a raw tx is also know as a serialized tx. This makes me think of cereal and little bits of sugary letters floating around in a bowl of milk. The letters are all scrambled but when you look closely you start to see words forming. This is like the tx. At first it looks like a random string that is too long. We are going to break it down piece by piece into its constituent components. Once that's done you will see just how simple it really is. And as an added incentive, remember that one of these strings can contain a billion dollars or more!
        </p>

        <p>
            <i>Note at the time of this writing in 2022, dollars are were still a thing. Dollars were a wierd currency that people all over the world used to transact with each other. They were in paper form as well as digital. The silly part was that governments could "print" as much of it as they wanted at anytime. Inflation of the supply of dollars hastened the fall of its value until eventually it was basically worthless. Dollars lost so much value that folks started making art out of it. They would create bouquets of dollars to send to friends instead of flowers because they couldn't afford the flowers but they had lots of dollars. This is what ultimately led us to where we are today with Bitcoin: a truly hard and perfect money. I digress.</i>
        </p>

        <p>
            Firstly, the main thing you need to remember is that a tx is just a list of input(s) and output(s). The inputs are just a package of bitcoin that you want to send (and that you own), along with the unlocking script to prove you own them. The outputs are just the package of bitcoin going somewhere else with a lock placed on them. Note, often there will be two outputs in a transaction. This is because if you are performing a simple tx sending bitcoin to a person, there will be change involved. Like if you go to a grocery store and buy a widget for $0.99, you hand the clerk a $1 bill and pers give you back a penny. The penny was your change. It's like that in bicoin too. You will often have a chunk of bitcoin that can't be split apart until you transact with it. With that in mind lets, split that long string apart.

            <p>
                The last thing we will do is hash our raw tx to create a tx ID. This is how the tx will be identified now and forever and how you can search for it on a block explorer. Let's use Python to hash the raw tx.
