        <div class="margins">
            <p>We have some Python code below verifies a signature (R,S) given a corresponding message and public key. In Bitcoin, signatures are DER encoded. This is just a standard way of serializing the data that makes communicating the information easier. Think of how we encode home addresses when sending a letter. We address the letter in a specific format so that the mailman can easily identify where the letter needs to be delivered. </p>

            <p> 
                One thing we wanted to point out here today is that R and S are different sizes, as you can see from the code below. So why is R 33 bytes and S is 32? Initial bytes 0x00 are generally not allowed in R and S. They will both have 32 bytes except if the leading byte > 0x7F. If this is the case, then 0x00 is prepended on that number. The reason is that DER encoding is a subset of Basic Encoding Rules (BER http://luca.ntop.org/Teaching/Appunti/asn1.html) and BER says that if the first byte > 0x7F then it is a negative number. openSSL knows that signatures are not negative (think finite field here) so instead of just ignoring this rule and viewing it as a positive number, and thus breaking the encoding rules, we just prepend 0x00 so that all is well. This explanation was inspired by Peter Wuille (on this post https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/12554/why-the-signature-is-always-65-13232-bytes-long).
            </p>            

            <p>
                Where initial 0x00 bytes for R and S are not allowed, except when their first byte would otherwise be above 0x7F (in which case a single 0x00 in front is required). Also note that inside transaction signatures, an extra hashtype byte follows the actual signature data. Also note that in a transaction the signature will have the sighash appended. Here it is not.
            </p>            
            
            <p>
                When you are performing the validation, you must make both R and S a combined 64 bytes. So that means, if either is preceded with 0x00, you must remove this extra byte. Else you will get a nasty error message from ECDSA module like:
                #ecdsa.keys.BadSignatureError: ('Malformed formatting of signature', MalformedSignature('Invalid length of signature, expected 64 bytes long, provided string is 65 bytes long'))

                python-ecdsa requires 64 byte input for creating the verifying key, I removed the first byte myself.

## some notes about DER encoding
# 0x30 byte is a header byte indicating a compound structure (starting DER sequence)
# 0x45 -- 69 length of the whole sequence in bytes (minus the header byte)
# 0x02 indicates an integer follows (BER standard)
# 0x21 length of integer to follow
# R
# 0x02 indicates an integer follows (BER standard)
# 0x20 length of integer to follow
# S
# in a transaction, a sighash is appended
